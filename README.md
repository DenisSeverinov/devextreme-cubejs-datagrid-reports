## DevExtreme + Cube.js

This repository contains a minimal, base configuration for demonstrating the initial setup of a frontend project that utilizes `Cube.js` and `DevExtreme DataGrids`. The purpose of this example is to show how easy and quick it is to set up a project that combines the power of `Cube.js` for flexible data manipulation with the feature-rich `DevExtreme DataGrids` for displaying data in an intuitive and visually appealing format.

### Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure to set up and run the `Cube.js` container by following the instructions provided in the [Cube.js service repository](https://github.com/DenisSeverinov/cubejs-service) and generate the Users schema. You can find more information on starting the development server and creating schemas in the official [Cube.js documentation](https://cube.dev/docs/getting-started/core/create-a-project#start-the-development-server).

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pnpm install` or your preferred package manager.
3. Run the frontend application using `pnpm dev` or the corresponding command for your package manager.
